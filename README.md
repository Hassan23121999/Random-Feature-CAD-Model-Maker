# Random-Feature-CAD-Model-Maker

## Project Description
This project provides a GUI tool for generating 3D CAD models with random features. Using `cadquery`, the script applies random geometrical transformations to basic box shapes, creating unique models each time. It supports exporting models to STEP format, suitable for further use in other CAD software or for manufacturing purposes.

## Features
- **Dynamic CAD Model Generation:** Create models with random features such as chamfers, fillets, holes, bosses, tapers, and ribs.
- **Interactive GUI:** Use a simple graphical interface to specify the number of models to generate and where to save them.
- **STEP Export:** Export the generated models as STEP files, a widely supported format in various CAD tools.
